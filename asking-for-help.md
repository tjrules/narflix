# Asking For Help


As this project is mostly self-driven we expect you to spend a lot of time debugging errors and problem solving on your own. However, if you hit a roadblock for more than an hour, please seek our help by following the steps below:
  1. Create a Github issue (**ON YOUR PROJECT's REPO**) with the following:
        * Be able to accurately describe your issue
        * Identify the code snippet that is giving you an issue
        * Tell us 3 things that you tried in order to solve the issue
        * _If_ there is an error message, tell us what that error message means
        * Assign **your squad leader** on the issue

  2. Following _**ALL**_ of the correct steps will result in either of the following:
        * A scheduled appointment with your instructor
        * A response in your issue - this will be used if there is a simple fix. If there isn't, this will result in an appointment with an instructor as well

Happy Coding!
