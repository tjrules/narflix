## Overview

You’ve already worked in small groups to accomplish various labs and exercises, but, this time, **we’re going to challenge you to work on a whole project with a small team.**

Not only will you be asked to **exercise additional creativity** in designing your project, but your instructors will also partner you with other classmates to architect, design, and collaboratively build an API of your design.

While your last project taught you how to get started with Node/Express and EJS to build a server side rendered CRUD application, for this project you'll be building an exciting single page application with **React**.

**This is meant to push you both technically and collaboratively.** Working in a team can be more challenging than working by yourself, but you're most likely going to find yourself working in a development team in your first job after WDI, and **it's important to learn how to work together.**

Make it work, and make it awesome.


## Technical Requirements

You must:

- **Use Postgres (pg-promise) & Express** to build an API and a **React** front-end that consumes it
- **Create an API using, at minimum, two related models**
- Include **CRUD functionality** in a **RESTful API** for at least one of those models
- **Consume your own API** by making your front-end with React
- **Consume at least one 3rd party API**
- **Craft thoughtful user stories together**, as a team
- **Create a project board** and use it to manage team workflow
- **Manage team contributions and collaboration** using a standard git workflow on GitHub
- **Designate one team member** to be in charge of managing team git workflow (the Git Tzar)
- Layout and style your front-end with **clean & well-formatted CSS**
- **Deploy your application online** so it's publicly accessible


## Necessary Deliverables

- A **working API, built by the whole team**, hosted somewhere on the internet
- A handmade front-end **that consumes your own API**, hosted somewhere on the internet
- A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
- A **team git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits from _every_ team member dating back to the _very beginning_ of the project
- **A ``readme.md`` file** with:
    - Explanations of the **technologies** used
    - A couple of paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
    - **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
    - Link to your ERDs - Diagrams of your models and their relationships
    - Link to your **user stories** – who are your users, what do they want, and why?
    - Link to your **wireframes** – sketches of  views and interfaces in your application
    - Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **hurdles** your team had to overcome


## Suggested Ways to Start

- **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short-term problems.
- **Read the docs for whatever technologies, frameworks, or API’s you use.**
- **Write your code DRY** and **build your APIs RESTful.**
- **Be consistent with your code style.** You're working in teams, but you're only making one app per team. Make sure it looks like a unified effort.
- **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
- **Keep user stories small and well-defined.** Remember – user stories focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
- **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about.** Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
- **Make it all well-formatted.** Are you indenting, consistently? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc.?
- **Comment your code.** Will someone understand what is going on in each block or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the what & why means someone else can pick it up and get it.
- **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.


## Before you Start

- **Draw ERDs (diagrams of how your tables will look)**
- **Write user stories**
- **Build wireframes**
- **Write a list of 3rd party technologies** that you will be using and need to explore before you dive head first into your project
- **Write a project proposal** to present to your instructor
- **Create a project board** that outlines what steps you will need to take and the order you plan to take them in. [Here's an example!](https://github.com/jlr7245/healthify/projects/1)
- **Define a styleguide** with your team. What fonts will you use, what color schemes? Be consistent with the styling.
- **Organize the project in terms of the directory structure etc.**
- **Define team roles and conflict resolution strategies.**


## Project Timeline

| Date | Action |
|:---:|---|
| **1/29** | Complete project Proposal, work on the [group bonding exercise](./group-bonding.md) |            
| **1/30** Morning  | **PROJECT PROPOSALS!** |
| **1/30** Afternoon | Work on wireframes, user stories, and a project board, get approval from your squad leader by the end of the day. |                                                            
| **1/31, 2/1, 1/2 ** | Check-in with your squad leader -- what have you done so far, what do you still need to accomplish, how do you plan to get there, etc. |
| **2/5** | **PROJECT PRESENTATIONS!** |

## Project Feedback + Evaluation

You will receive **ONE** collaborative grade as a group.

## Submission

In the body of the ticket include:
1. Link to your deployed app
2. Link to the project GitHub repo
3. Wins, struggles, comments, etc....



## A Note on Plagiarism

General Assembly has a **zero tolerance policy** towards plagiarism and cheating. It is destructive to classroom culture, and exhibits a clear lack of respect for classmates, instructors, the company, and the greater community. Any work considered to have been plagiarised will not be accepted and will not count towards graduation requirements. If a project exhibits evidence of plagiarism or cheating, the student will not be able to display the project at a GA-sponsored class “science fair” or “meet & greet.” Any student found plagiarising or attempting to plagiarise will be disciplined accordingly (including but not limited to removal from class).

Open source code is inherently open and usually available for free use to modify and implement into any non-commercial project. However, please review their license and usage guidelines, give credit to the project and/or author, and do not try to hide or disguise the usage of such code.

You are encouraged to ask others, including students, instructors, and stackoverflow, for help. However, it is NOT ACCEPTABLE TO COPY another person's code and submit it as your own. More importantly, it is detrimental to your learning and growth.

All of the following are considered plagiarism or cheating:
- Turning in work that is not your own.
- Turning in someone else's work as your own.
- Hiring, or paying someone to do your work for you.
- Copying words or code without giving credit.
- Building or copying someone else’s idea without their knowledge or giving credit.
- Giving incorrect information about a source.
- Changing words, variable names, etc. but copying the code or files of a source without giving credit.
- Copying so many ideas or code blocks from a source that it makes up the majority of your work, whether you give credit or not.
- Failing to put a quotation in quotation marks.
